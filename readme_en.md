# Final Project of LAMIA Bootcamp

## LAMIA

LAMIA, located on the UTFPR campus in Santa Helena, is a research center dedicated to the application of Data Science and Computer Vision in the industry. It develops technology and academic knowledge for the sector, with a team of collaborators spread throughout the country.

## Bootcamp and Journey

Upon joining the laboratory, it is necessary to go through a training bootcamp and develop a final project that showcases one's skills and contributions. During this process, participants are considered beginners and have a deadline to complete the training. The laboratory covers various areas, and I chose to focus on Machine Learning.

## Chosen Challenge

For my final project, I chose the following challenge:

- To compare three famous convolutional models currently available.
    - The models must classify Covid-19 and Pneumonia from an X-ray image.

The chosen models were:

- ResNet50
- VGG16
- InceptionV3

All available for use in the TensorFlow library.

# Dataset

The training and validation of the models were based on a merge of the following datasets:

- Covid-19 Image Dataset.
    - Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset

- COVIDx CXR-4.
    - Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andyczhao/covidx-cxr2

- Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) with new class.
    - Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhaytham/chest-xray-images-pneumonia-with-new-clas

Resulting in 9423 images for training and 2353 images for validation.

# Results

I am pleased to inform that I achieved consistent results.
For better consistency among comparisons, analyzing only the accuracy and loss of the models would not be sufficient.
Therefore, detailed results are available in the testing-models.ipynb file. In it, it is possible to analyze the accuracy of each model in each case.

These results establish a promising foundation for future enhancements and applications. Therefore, I intend to continue developing my skills in Machine Learning at LAMIA.
